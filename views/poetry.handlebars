      <h2 class="poem-title" id="poemTitle">A Set of Three</h2>
      <pre class="poem-text" id="poemText">Three hearts, three souls…
Entangled in life’s chaotic show.
Eyes once filled with innocence and love,
Cries ocean on what has become.

All that’s left is rage and guilt,
Questioning everything that was built.
Each made a promise to stay,
Only to watch everything fade away.

Love’s no garden of endless roses,
A fire that burnt fierce, now dark and frozen.
A desperate plea to stay strong,
The battle between right and wrong.

Heart or mind—what would be your choice?
Misery follows regardless, cannot avoid.
Imprisoned by the hands of fate,
Inner calling to break free of the torment.

A heart once broken, torn in pain,
Piece by piece, you’ll rise again.</pre>
